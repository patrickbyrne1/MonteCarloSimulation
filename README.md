# MonteCarloSimulation
A project from CS475: Introduction to Parallel Programming at OSU.  The purpose of the project is to investigate the accuracy of parallel programming on Monte Carlo simulations.  It uses C++ and OpenCL to perform the Monte Carlo simulations.  A python script is used to collect the data from each run of the simulation and analyze it.
